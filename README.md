# Count-It-App

Count-It is a simple, intuitive app designed to help users keep track of their cans and bottles while estimating the money they can earn by recycling. Whether youâ€™re collecting for fun, fundraising, or sustainability, Count-It makes the process easy and efficient.

## Features

- Manual Input: Quickly log the number of cans you have by entering them manually.
- Photo Counting: Take a picture of a bundle of cans, and Count-It will calculate the quantity for you using image recognition
- Earnings Estimation: See how much money you'll make when you deposit your cnas ta the local recyling depot
- History: See all past logs, organized by date, with money total for each day

## How it works

Count-It uses a AI-powered image recognition to automatically count the cans in your photos and estimate recycling earnings.

1. Image Upload:
   Users start by taking or uploading a photo of their bundle of cans.
2. OpenCV Processing:
   Using OpenCV, the backend enhances the image for better visability by converting it to grayscale, reducing noise, and detecting edges and contours-- producing the OpenCV-based can count.
3. Google Vision AI
   The full image is additionally sent to Google's Vision AI
   The AI identifies objects in the image and matches them against a list of "can-like" keywords such as can, aluminum, soda, drink, or bottle.
   This produces a Vision API estimate of the can count.
4. Final Count:
   A combined algorithm (in development) will merge results from both the OpenCV and Google Vision AI analyses to produce a more accurate final count.
5. Earnings Calculations:
   Based on the final can count, Count-It calculates the estimated deposit refund a user would earn at their local recycling depot.
